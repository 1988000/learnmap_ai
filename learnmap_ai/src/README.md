# LearnMap AI - Interactive Learning Platform

## Overview
LearnMap AI is a self-paced interactive learning platform built using the Jac programming language. The platform allows learners to progress through lessons, tasks, and quizzes while a backend object-spatial graph (OSP) models their mastery over concepts. Walkers track progress, and collectors gather learner activity for adaptive learning.

## Features
- Structured lessons and quizzes
- Node-based learning graph using Jac
- Walkers and CollectorWalkers track and record progress
- Adaptive learning logic using byLLM agents (optional integration)
- Clean and modular code structure
